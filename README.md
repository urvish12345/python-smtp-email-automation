# 📧 Python Email Automation using SMTP  

Automating emails is a powerful way to save time and ensure timely communication for **reminders, reports, notifications, and alerts**. This project demonstrates how to send emails programmatically using **Python’s built-in `smtplib` and `email` modules** with Gmail’s SMTP server.

## 🚀 Features  
- Send automated emails with **custom subject and body**  
- Supports **Gmail SMTP (SSL)**  
- Useful for **reminders, reports, notifications, alerts, and bulk emails**  
- Lightweight – built using only Python standard libraries  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Create a Python script that automates sending emails via SMTP – useful for **reminders, reports, or alerts**.  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- Gmail account with **App Passwords enabled** (for security)

## ⚡ Setup Instructions  

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification** in your Gmail account.  
2. **Generate an App Password** from Google (use this instead of your normal Gmail password).  
3. Replace the placeholders in the script:  
   ```python
   email['From'] = 'your_email@gmail.com'
   smtp.login('your_email@gmail.com', 'your_app_password')
   send_email('receiver_email@gmail.com', 'Test Subject', 'Hello, this is a test email!')
   ```
4. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python email_automation.py
   ```

## 🔒 Security Note  
- Never hardcode your real Gmail password in scripts.  
- Always use **App Passwords** for SMTP authentication.  
- Consider storing credentials in **environment variables** or a `.env` file.
